# LLaMA Model Inference Tests

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for testing different versions of LLaMA models, including LLaMA 2 and Code LLaMA. The notebooks showcase the inference capabilities of these models across various general and coding-related prompts.

## Repository Contents

- `llama-2-7b-chat-hf-inference.ipynb`: Testing general question-answering capabilities of the LLaMA 2 model.
- `code-llama-7b-instruct-hf-inference.ipynb`: Testing code generation and coding-related problem-solving capabilities of the Code LLaMA model.
- `llama-3-8b-chat-hf-inference.ipynb`: Testing advanced chat capabilities of the LLaMA 3 model.

## Models Tested

- **LLaMA 2 7B Chat HF**: This model is designed for general question-answering and conversational tasks.
- **Code LLaMA 7B Instruct HF**: This model is specifically fine-tuned for coding and technical problem-solving tasks.
- **LLaMA 3 8B Chat HF**: This model provides advanced conversational capabilities with a larger parameter set.
