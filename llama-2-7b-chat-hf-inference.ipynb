Chlorophyll absorbs blue and red light, while carotenoids absorb yellow light.\n2. Light-dependent reactions: The light energy absorbed by chlorophyll and carotenoids is used to convert water and carbon dioxide into ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). These energy-rich molecules are produced through a series of chemical reactions that take place in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.\n3.

He would often sneak away from his hoard to watch them practice, mesmerized by their fluid movements and the way they seemed to glide across the floor.\n\nBut Scorch's love of dance was not just a passing fancy. He was determined to become a skilled dancer himself, and he spent every spare moment practicing in front of his mirror.

Meditation: Meditation can help calm the mind and reduce stress by focusing on the present moment. Try setting aside 10-15 minutes each day to sit quietly, close your eyes, and focus on your breath.\n3. Deep Breathing: Deep breathing can help reduce stress by slowing down your heart rate and promoting relaxation. Try inhaling for a count of four, holding your breath for a count of four, and exhaling for a count of four.\n4. Progressive Muscle Relaxation: This technique involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body to release tension.

The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th term of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nThe function uses a recursive approach, where it calls itself with `n - 1` and `n - 2` as arguments, and then adds the results together to get the final answer.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the function:\n```\nconsole.log(fibonacci(5)); // Output: 5\n```\nThis would calculate the 5th term of the Fibonacci sequence, which is 5.\n\nI hope this helps!
