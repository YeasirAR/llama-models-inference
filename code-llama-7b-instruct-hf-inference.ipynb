Light energy from the sun enters the plant through its leaves.\n2. The light energy excites the chloroplasts, which contain pigments such as chlorophyll.\n3. The pigments absorb the light energy and transfer it to a molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the energy currency of the cell.\n4. The ATP is then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n5. The glucose is used by the plant for energy and growth, while the oxygen is released into the air as a byproduct.\n\nOverall, photosynthesis is a critical process that allows plants to convert sunlight into energy, which is then used to fuel their growth and development. \n\n**<font color='magenta'>Total time:</font>** 15.09 sec."},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"\n\n**<font color='red'>Question:</font>** What is the capital of France? \n\n**<font color='green'>Answer:</font>** The capital of France is Paris. \n\n**<font color='magenta'>Total time:</font>** 0.56 sec."},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"\n\n**<font color='red'>Question:</font>** Write a short story about a dragon who wants to learn how to dance. \n\n**<font color='green'>Answer:</font>** Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a dragon named Scorch.

He had always been content to spend his days lounging in the sun and breathing fire, but he had always dreamed of learning how to dance.\n\nOne day, Scorch decided that he had had enough of his mundane life. He packed his bags and set off on a journey to find the best dance instructor in the land. He traveled for many days, over mountains and through forests, until he finally came to a small village nestled in the heart of a dense forest.\n\nAs he entered the village, Scorch was greeted by the sound of music and laughter. He followed the sound to a small tavern, where he found a group of people gathered around a stage, dancing and singing.

It starts by checking if the input `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function returns `n` because the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. Otherwise, the function calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and returns the sum of the two results.\n\nFor example, if you call the function with `n = 5`, it will calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the 5th term, which is 5. The function will call itself with `n-1 = 4` and `n-2 = 3`, and return the sum of the two results, which is 7.
