For centuries, he had roamed the skies, breathing fire and hoarding treasure. But as the years went by, Ember began to feel a strange, unfamiliar longing. He yearned to do something that brought him joy, something that made him feel alive.\n\nOne day, while soaring above the treetops, Ember spotted a group of faeries dancing in a clearing. Their delicate wings fluttered in rhythm, and their laughter echoed through the forest. Entranced, Ember landed nearby, watching the faeries with wide, curious eyes.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, the faeries vanished, leaving behind a small, intricately carved wooden box. Ember's curiosity got the better of him, and he opened the box to find a note that read:\n\n\"For the dragon who dares to dream,\nLearn to dance, and your heart will sing.\nSeek out the wise old badger,\nWho teaches steps to those who linger.\"\n\nIntrigued, Ember set out to find the wise old badger.

It's the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, but its applications extend far beyond digital currency.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation of how it works:\n\n1. **Decentralized network**: A network of computers, called nodes, is established to validate and record transactions.\n2. **Blocks**: Each node receives a block of transactions, which is a collection of data, such as financial transactions, smart contracts, or other types of data.\n3. **Chain**: Each block is linked to the previous block through a unique code, called a \"hash,\" creating a chain of blocks. This chain is the blockchain.\n4. **Cryptography**: Each block is encrypted using advanced mathematical algorithms, making it difficult to alter or manipulate the data within.\n5. **Consensus mechanism**: Nodes on the network verify the transactions and blocks, ensuring that the data is accurate and consistent. This is achieved through a consensus mechanism, such as proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS).\n6. **Immutable**: Once a block is added to the blockchain, the data it contains becomes immutable, meaning it cannot be altered or deleted.\n7. ** \n\n**<font color='magenta'>Total time:</font>** 17.34 sec."},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"system_prompt = \"\"\"\nYou are an AI assistant designed to solve coding related problem.\n\"\"\"\ntest_inputs = [\n    \"Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number.\",\n    \"Generate a Python function to check if a number is prime.\",\n    \"Create a Python script that reads a file and prints its contents.\",\n    \n    \"Write a JavaScript function to reverse a string.\",\n    \"Generate a JavaScript function to find the maximum value in an array.\",\n    \"Create a JavaScript function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.\",\n    \n    \"Write a Java method to check if a number is even or odd.\",\n    \"Generate a Java program to print 'Hello, World!' to the console.\",\n    \"Create a Java class to represent a Book with attributes title, author, and ISBN.\",\n    \n    \"Write a C++ function to swap two numbers using pointers.\",\n    \"Generate a C++ program to implement a simple calculator.\",\n    \"Create a C++ class to represent a Circle with methods to calculate the area and circumference.\",\n    \n    \"Write a Ruby method to convert a string to uppercase.\",\n    \"Generate a Ruby function to check if a number is a palindrome.\",\n    \"Create a Ruby script to read a file and display its contents.\",\n    \n    \"Write a Go function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\",\n    \"Generate a Go program to print the first 10 prime numbers.\",\n    \"Create a Go struct to represent a Person with attributes name and age.\",\n    \n    \"Write a SQL query to find all records in a table called 'employees' where the salary is greater than 50000.\",\n    \"Generate a SQL query to create a table named 'students' with columns id, name, and grade.\",\n    \"Create a SQL query to update the email of a user with id 5 in the 'users' table.\"\n]\n\nfor prompt in test_inputs:\n    result = generate_response(\n        system_prompt,\n        user_prompt=prompt,\n        temp=0.1,\n        max_len=256\n    )\n    display(Markdown(highlight_text(result)))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-10T15:34:48.525986Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-10T15:34:48.526527Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-10T15:40:53.151471Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-10T15:34:48.526502Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-10T15:40:53.150548Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"\n\n**<font color='red'>Question:</font>** Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number. \n\n**<font color='green'>Answer:</font>** Here is a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing an integer as an argument.

So we use the `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` trick to get the upper bound for the loop.\n3.
